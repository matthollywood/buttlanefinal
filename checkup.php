       <h4>Appointments</h4>
     </div>
      We do try to see patients at the appointed time. IF you are kept waiting there is normally a good reason. For instance we may have an emergency to treat. If you have to cancel an appointment,
      we need 24 hours notice. This allows us to use your appointment to see someone else. There may be a charge for appointments cancelled with less than 24 hours notice or broken without notice.
      If 2 or more appointments are missed then the practice may not offer you treatment in the future.
