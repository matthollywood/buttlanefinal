        <h4>NHS and Private Treatment</h4>
      </div>
       A full range of NHS treatments are available to NHS patients as we long as we have NHS funding left to cover them. </br>
       Also, we may provide some cosmetic treatments to NHS patients but only on a private basis. Private patients are entitled to a wide range of dental treatment including all cosmetic
       options. The majority of treatments we can provide at this practice but sometimes, if we think it is in the patient's best interest, we will refer to a specialist.  We are happy to give you details of private
       treatments available and the costs involved. Please ask the dentist for a written quote which will be valid for 6 months.

     <h4>Appointments</h4>
   </div>
    We do try to see patients at the appointed time. If you are kept waiting there is normally a good reason. For instance we may have an emergency to treat. If you have to cancel an appointment,
    we need 24 hours notice. This allows us to use your appointment to see someone else. There may be a charge for appointments cancelled with less than 24 hours notice or broken without notice.
    If 2 or more appointments are missed then the practice may not offer you treatment in the future.

       <h4>Payment</h4>
     </div>
   This practice accepts most debit and credit cards. There is no charge for debit or credit cards. Payment is expected in advance of treatment before further appointments are booked.
   Your dentist will be happy to discuss the costs of different treatments and sometimes it may be possible to stage work so as to spread the cost.
