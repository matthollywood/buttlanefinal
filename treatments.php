    <h3>Visiting the Dental Hygienist</h3>
  </div>

Most modern practices will have a dental hygienist who works with your dentist to ensure that you are looking after your teeth properly.  The role of the dental hygienist is to monitor your rate of gum disease and recommend steps that you yourself can take to avoid serious dental work in the future.  Therefore it is very much in your interests to listen to what they have to say.



If you visit your dental hygienist, they will begin with a scale and polish, during which the plaque and tartar are removed from your teeth.  The advice from your hygienist will then involve recommendations on how you can avoid plaque and tartar building up in the future.  They may recommend a different way to brush your teeth, possibly giving up smoking or making changes to your diet to protect your teeth in the future.
