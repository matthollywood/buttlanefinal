    <p>We endeavour to see all patients and have a fully equipped downstairs surgery and a toilet both with wheelchair access.  There is a small step up at the front door which most wheelchair users can use but we do have a portable ramp which can be placed if this is a problem.  If you have any
    disability that you think we need to know about please contact us before your appointment and we will do our best to put suitable arrangements in place. See our Access statement by clicking <a href="documents/access.pdf"> HERE </a> </p>
