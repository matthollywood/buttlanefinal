        <h2>What is a Dental Hygienist-Therapist?</h2>
      </div>

          <p>
This joint qualification allows the dental professional, when asked by the dentist, to treat periodontal (gum) disease and do all the treatments allowed by a hygienist including using local anaesthetics. It also allows them to fill teeth on adults and children and also to remove childrenâ€™s teeth and carry out many other treatments that previously were only allowed to be carried out by dentists.
